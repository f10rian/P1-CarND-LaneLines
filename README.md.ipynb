    "### Pipeline overview \n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1 - Load color image\n",
    "* Step 2 - Convert image into grayscale image\n",
    "* Step 3 - Apply blur filter\n",
    "* Step 4 - Apply canny edge detection\n",
    "* Step 5 - Select region of interest (roi)\n",
    "* Step 6 - Find lines using hough transform\n",
    "* Step 7 - Separate lines into left and right, average and extrapolate them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 - Load color image\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step an image was read with the `mpimg.imread()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Original image](./test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 - Convert image into grayscale image\n",
    "\n",
    "The origignal image is converted into grayscale with the `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grayscale image](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_gray.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3 - Apply blur filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The image is blurred with the `cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)` function to remove noise for a better canny edge performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Blurred image](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_gray_blr.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4 - Apply canny edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "For canny edge detection the `cv2.Canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold)` function was applied. The threshold values were determined following the recommendation of the lecture (low:high threshold ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 in range of tens to hundreds).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Canny edge detection](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_canny.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5 - Select region of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "The region of interest was determined by the shape of the lanes in the images. The function `cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices, ignore_mask_color)` sets the color in the region of interest to white, whereafter the mask is used by `cv2.bitwise_and(img, mask)` to keep only the specified region of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Region of interest](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_roi.jpg)\n",
    "![Region of interest in canny edge image](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_canny_roi.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6 - Find lines using hough transform\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding lines, the probabilistic hough transform function `cv2.HoughLinesP(img, rho, theta, threshold, np.array([]), minLineLength=min_line_len, maxLineGap=max_line_gap)` was used, since it returns the extremes of the detected lines instead of $\\theta$ and $\\rho$. The relevant parameters were set by set by trial and error. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Hough transformed image](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_hough.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7 - Separate lines into left and right, average and extrapolate them\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to draw one single line on the left and one on the right lane, the function `avg_extrapol(lines)` was created. It works as follows:\n",
    "* Left and right lines are separated by their slope\n",
    "* Slopes and offsets are averaged respectively\n",
    "* The extremes of the two resulting lines are returned\n",
    "\n",
    "![Final image](./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_final_image.jpg)\n",

    "One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... \n",
    "\n",
    "Another shortcoming could be ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to ..."
